# Sleep Disorder Prediction Using Machine Learning  

This project uses machine learning to predict sleep disorders based on health and lifestyle data, enabling early diagnosis and preventive care.

## 📂 **Overview**  
The dataset includes features such as:  
- **Age**, **Gender**, **Occupation**  
- **Sleep Duration**, **Quality of Sleep**, **Physical Activity Level**  
- **Stress Level**, **BMI**, **Blood Pressure**, **Heart Rate**, **Daily Steps**  
- **Sleep Disorder** (target: 1 if true, 0 if false)  

## ⚙️ **Tools and Libraries**  
- **Python**, with:  
  - Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation  
  - Scikit-learn for machine learning  
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization  

## 🛠️ **Steps**  
1. **Preprocessing**: Handled missing data, encoded categorical variables, scaled features, and analyzed feature importance.  
2. **Models Used**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and KNN.  
3. **Evaluation**: Metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score, with k-fold cross-validation.  

## 📈 **Results**  
- Developed a reliable model with high accuracy after tuning.  
- Identified key features affecting sleep disorders.
  
## 📚 **Inspiration**  
Inspired by the IEEE paper *"Applying Machine Learning Algorithms for Classification of Sleep Disorder"*.
